"""
Looks like this is similar to Montco's. They have it split by RACE then page-splitting tables for the precinct results.
The pages split tables in both directions, because why the fuck not.

I think the approach is to manually figure out what pages correspond to what races, then pass those sets to a new
prompt pipeline.

Put on backburner. Will be like Montcos.
